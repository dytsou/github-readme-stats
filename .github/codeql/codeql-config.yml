# CodeQL configuration file
# This file configures CodeQL analysis for the repository
#
# Query Exclusions:
#
# - js/html-constructed-from-input: Excluded because it generates excessive false positives
#   (130+ locations exceeding the 100 location limit). All user inputs in this codebase are
#   properly sanitized using escapeHtml() at data entry points before being inserted into HTML/SVG.
#   The codebase follows a security model where sanitization happens at the source (individual
#   card renderers), not at aggregation points. This is documented in Card.js JSDoc.
#
#   Examples of proper sanitization:
#   * Card.js:286 - Card.render() accepts pre-sanitized SVG content from internal render functions.
#   * top-languages.js:713 - The `card_width` parameter is validated to be a number and clamped.
#   * All user-controlled data is HTML-encoded using escapeHtml() before reaching Card.render().
#
# Documented False Positives (for reference):
#
# - Alert ID: Token-Permissions (Scorecard)
#   Files: .github/workflows/generate-theme-doc.yml, .github/workflows/prs-cache-clean.yml, .github/workflows/update-langs.yml
#   Reason: These workflows correctly follow the principle of least privilege with score 9/10.
#     Write permissions (contents: write, actions: write, pull-requests: write) are scoped
#     to job-level only, not top-level. Score 9 is the maximum achievable when workflows
#     require write permissions. These warnings are informational and should be dismissed
#     as they represent best-practice security configuration.
