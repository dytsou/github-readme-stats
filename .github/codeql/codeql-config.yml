#
# Documented False Positive:
# - Alert ID: js/html-constructed-from-input
# - File: src/common/Card.js:286
# - Reason: Card.render() accepts pre-sanitized SVG content from internal render functions.
#   All user inputs are HTML-encoded at source using escapeHtml() before reaching
#   Card.render(). This is a trusted internal API - see Card.js JSDoc for full
#   security model documentation. The sanitization happens at data entry points
#   (individual card renderers), not at aggregation points.
