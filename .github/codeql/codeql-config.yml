#
# Documented False Positives:
#
# - Alert ID: js/html-constructed-from-input
#   File: src/common/Card.js:286
#   Reason: Card.render() accepts pre-sanitized SVG content from internal render functions.
#     All user inputs are HTML-encoded at source using escapeHtml() before reaching
#     Card.render(). This is a trusted internal API - see Card.js JSDoc for full
#     security model documentation. The sanitization happens at data entry points
#     (individual card renderers), not at aggregation points.
#
# - Alert ID: Token-Permissions (Scorecard)
#   Files: .github/workflows/generate-theme-doc.yml, .github/workflows/prs-cache-clean.yml, .github/workflows/update-langs.yml
#   Reason: These workflows correctly follow the principle of least privilege with score 9/10.
#     Write permissions (contents: write, actions: write, pull-requests: write) are scoped
#     to job-level only, not top-level. Score 9 is the maximum achievable when workflows
#     require write permissions. These warnings are informational and should be dismissed
#     as they represent best-practice security configuration.
